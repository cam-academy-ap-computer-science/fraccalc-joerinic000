You passed Checkpoint 3 perfectly, so your calculations were all correct, so you
get perfect marks on Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
However, you did not present your results correctly in many cases.  For example,
the simple 1 / 2 returns 0_1/2, when it should return simply 1/2.  There are
many examples like that, which is why a large number of the Final tests failed.
The calculations were correct, but the final display was incorrect.
